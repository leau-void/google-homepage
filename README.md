This is a project I completed as part of The Odin Project's Foundation Path.
The assignments was to make a clone of the Google homepage(obviously). 

I gave myself a single day to do this project, and I probably would've continued until it was pixel-perfect otherwise.

I decided to try figuring out the "ways" in which the page was made/structured all by myself, and to rely on MDN Web Docs when I couldn't figure out by myself how to style the page to make it fit with the structure I decided to adopt.

I only used the developer tools on Google's homepage to sample exact colors, and for confirming some things that I was trying to do (pixels, font-size, media query).

There are some things that ended up working, but I knew I was taking a shortcut and I hope I will still find out what the problem was (ie: in my top bar's links the top margins were working only when they were on a parent element, not when they were directly on the links? that puzzled me for a little bit...)

I made a point of typing everything by hand, without even copy/paste, to practice my keyboard writing skills.

I probably spent more time than I should have, but I am still proud of the results and of having figured out the entirety of the layout by myself.
